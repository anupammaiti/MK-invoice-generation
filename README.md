# MK-invoice-generation
An application I wrote, during my internship at MeritKapital Ltd., that handles the generation, deletion 
and updating of invoices for the company.

It can also convert an invoice to a pdf file and view an invoice in-browser (html).

-This is my first Spring powered application and also the first time I ever used JavaScript, jQuery and iText 7.
